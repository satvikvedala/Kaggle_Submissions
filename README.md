Repository belongs to ipynb of Kaggle
Hi I am Satvik, Thi is my repository of Kaggle Submisions. I am a data & ML Algorithm ethusiast, currently a novice candidate working to develop my skills in this area.

In this repository I deal with many datasets starting from

1. dealing with _**Pima India Diabetes Dataset**_ using
  
    a. Logitic Regression
  
    b. Naive Bayes
  
    c. KNN
  
    d. Decision Tree
  
    e. SVM
